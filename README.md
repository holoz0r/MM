A budget tracker thingo

Sick of budget trackers taking all your info, or requiring an account to sign in? 

This simple tracker comes without any of that. It uses your local storage, or you can download a JSON file (which is just a way of storing data in plain text) - which you can load later. 

You can even save the HTML, Script and StyleSheet on your own device (even a mobile / tablet) - and not need an Internet connection at all. 

This one is modelled after a spreadsheet I've been maintaining for years, and that I'm finally happy with. 

1. Add your income (Done!)
2. Add your expenses (Done!)
3. See the delta between the two (Coming) 
4. Add your mortgage, credit card, or saving accounts (Done)
5. See somme analysis (Coming)
6. See an assessment of how long you have to live (financially, at least)

I'm not a professional web developer, my experience is data analytics and very probably having autism, so this tool is likely written quite poorly.
